# DISCLAIMER

**WARNING: DO NOT USE ON REAL ROBOTS WITHOUT EXPERT REVIEW AND SAFETY MEASURES**

This project is designed for research and educational purposes only. It is NOT intended for real-world robot deployment without proper safety measures, expert review, and extensive testing.

## Safety Considerations

- This code contains no hardware safety limits or emergency stop mechanisms
- No real-time guarantees or safety-critical validation
- Simulation environments may not accurately represent real-world dynamics
- Control algorithms have not been validated for physical robot safety
- No fail-safe mechanisms for hardware protection

## For Real Robot Deployment

Before using any part of this code on physical robots:

1. **Expert Review Required**: Have robotics safety experts review all control algorithms
2. **Hardware Safety**: Implement proper velocity/effort limits, emergency stops, and watchdog timers
3. **Real-time Validation**: Ensure real-time performance requirements are met
4. **Extensive Testing**: Test in controlled environments with safety personnel
5. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct thorough risk analysis for your specific application
6. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant safety standards (ISO 10218, etc.)

## Liability

The authors and contributors of this project assume no responsibility for any damage, injury, or loss resulting from the use of this code on real robots. Users assume full responsibility for ensuring safety when deploying on physical systems.

## Educational Use Only

This project is intended for:
- Learning robotics concepts
- Research and experimentation
- Algorithm development and testing
- Academic and educational purposes

Use at your own risk and responsibility.
